# DE2-CPULite
This project mimics most of the properties of a 32-bit MIPS-Lite architecture. It includes an Instruction Register, ALU, temporary register control, Control logic, and data memory

From this project, I learned:

1. How to program logical operations and comparison instructions using an instruction register
2. Use of Data Memory to store data that is being held witin temporary registers
3. Understand the Control logic for when an instruction is received, it will perform the right logic using appropriate gating
  mechanisms

*Note that simulation doesn't work 100%*
